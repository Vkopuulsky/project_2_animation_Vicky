    <h1>Pac-man</h1>
    <p>Pac-man was hungry so he went out for a walk to find food. He was strolling
      through his home when he noticed some yummy looking white cirles. And of course
      the first thing he does is eat them. But the circle put him in a trance
      where he moves the sme way over and over again.</p>
